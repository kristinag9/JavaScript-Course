1. AJAX -> Asynchronous JS And XML
The idea of it is:
Using the request asynchronously to load some data from the server or to send data to the server (to the db)

2. AJAJ -> Asynchronous JS And JSON

3. XHR and fetch

4. XML
- markup language
- formatting data using tags

5. JSON -> Javascript Object Notation
- formatting data
- js object
- key-value pairs which are strings

{
   name: {
      first: "",
      second: ""
   }
}

6. XMLHttpRequest
- the original way of sending requests via JS
- does not support promises => lots of callbacks
